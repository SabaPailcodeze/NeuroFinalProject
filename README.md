**Neuro** is a beautifully designed and fully responsive web project built during the final stage of the **Re:educate Bootcamp**.  
The goal was to convert a Figma design into a real-world, production-ready website using modern web technologies.

- 💡 **Design to Code:** The UI was entirely based on a Figma prototype, translated pixel-perfectly into code.
- 🚀 **Deployed Live:** The project is live on **Vercel**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
